## Introduction to the Project

- **Title**: Unobstructive Monitoring of Vulnerable Elderly

- **Project Goal**: To develop a _non-invasive_ home-monitoring system for vulnerable elderly that provides _unobtrusive fall detection_ and _activity level tracking_ that preserves individual privacy and can be readily integrated into existing infrastructure
